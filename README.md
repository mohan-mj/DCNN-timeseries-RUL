# DCNN for Machine RUL Prediction using Time-series Data

In the session I will talk on RUL (Remaining Useful Life) estimation of a machine using sensor data. I will use a realistic multivariate time-series data for leveraging the power of deep neural networks in the hands-on. RUL is the remaining time or cycles that the machine is likely to operate without any failure. By estimating RUL the operator can decide the frequency of scheduled maintenance and avoid unplanned downtime. We will be focusing on building a DCNN (Deep Convolutional Neural Networks) model for the prediction.
